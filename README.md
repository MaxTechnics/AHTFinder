# Apple Hardware Test Download finder
This bash script checks the Hardware Model, Board ID and returns the download link of the AHT dmg file you can use to diagnose your Mac.

## About Apple Hardware Test
Apple Hardware Test (AHT) was an often built in diagnostic tool used to detect problems with your Mac system. Apple changed to another Diagnostic system starting with Macs released in June 2013. This means that the script will not find a download for newer Macs as they do not support AHT. This is a great tool however to find the right link automatically.

We will be adding more info and explaining how to use the script once the first version is done.
